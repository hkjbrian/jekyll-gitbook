출석하세종 is a open source project.

출석하세종(AttendSejong) is a mobile application designed to enhance the Jiphyeon campus(e-campus) experience by providing students with timely notifications for online classes and assignments. Our primary goal is to empower students to seamlessly navigate their online classes by delivering real-time attendance tracking and assignment management alerts, ensuring they never miss a class or a submission deadline.





## How to Get Started

This theme can be used just as other [Jekyll themes][1] and support [remote theme][12],
see [the official guide][13] as well.

You can introduce this jekyll theme into your own site by either

- [Fork][3] this repository and add your markdown posts to the `_posts` folder.
- Use as a remote theme in your [`_config.yml`][14](just like what we do for this
  site itself),

```yaml
remote_theme: sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook
```
